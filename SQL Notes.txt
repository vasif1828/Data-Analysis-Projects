-- TRÄ°GGERS -- 

Triggers are used to automate the tasks (the tasks which are executed after the defined commmand is executed)

Example: 

CREATE TRIGGER my_adder_trigger AFTER INSERT ON mytable
SET @salary_total_amount = @salary_total_amount + NEW.salary_amount ; 

I have created a TRIGGER which is activated after any INSERT command. We have the following table, let's see what happens after executing insert function

              name      |    surname        |  salary_amount |  salary_total_amount
              Aghamirza |   Khudoyberganov  |    1500        |      1500 



INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('Alexander', 'Rybak', 5500); 

              name      |    surname        |  salary_amount |  salary_total_amount
              Aghamirza |   Khudoyberganov  |    1500        |      1500 
              Alexander |   Rybak           |     5500       |      7000


* MySQL supports only row-level TRIGGERS, however in other syntax languages, statement-level Triggers are supported. 
* MySQL doesn`t support ALTER TRIGGER, therefore in order to modify TRIGGER, just DROP it, then CREATE it!
* INSERT triggers do not work with OLD key (old value), DELETE triggers do not work with NEW key. 

Syntax of TRIGGER:

        CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name                                               % creating trigger by giving the name
        {BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}                               % use either BEFORE or AFTER, INSERT or UPDATE or DELETE
        ON table_name FOR EACH ROW                                                % apply it for each row in the given table
        
        {{FOLLOWS | PRECEDES} existing _trigger_name}                             % this determines whether the trigger is applied after previous trigger
        
        [some statement we want to execute by trigger]                            % given statement
        
        WHERE column_name = {NEW | OLD}.column_name                               % don't use NEW with DELETE, and OLD with INSERT
